 oh hey, you found a secret bio through this mess!
congrats.

anyways, i'm river, you can call me river. i'm a 0 year old homo sapiens coder who decided they didn't have anything better to do in their life so they made a github account to share their code with literally 8 billion people.

here's a few extra things about me:
i'm someone who doesn't exist.
i'm someone who doesn't care what you do as long as it doesnt involve me. aka, dont force anything on to me such as religion, sexuality, etc.
i'm a very patient person.
i have many names, roughly around 20 of them, to be a little more precise. and that's not including the nicknames lmao

i think that's all you need to know. maybe i'll upload and delete another one containing more info, who knows.
welp, i guess bye, have fun lurking around here

- River
